        <div class="event-desc">
          Wardy, do you remember July 6th, 2024? You were wearing your Lakers hoodie, and that day our friendship started. You used to call me Abdo, and I called you Abu Huzaim. We chatted all the time. That day was the beginning of the most beautiful thing in my life.

        <div class="event-desc">
          Fast-forward to August, and we were so close. We talked all the time, and I even told you stories before we slept. I had feelings for you, Wardy. I loved you, but I didn’t know how to say it. And during that time, you introduced me to matcha, and I got hookeddddd to it because of you.

        <div class="event-title">Opening My Heart <span>Early September 2024</span></div>
        <div class="event-desc">
          When my family went back and I stayed alone, I finally opened my heart to you in early September. I wasn’t sure if you’d accept how I felt, but you gave me a chance. Since that day, my life has gotten better in every way. You inspire me to be the best version of myself. You accepted my love, and not only that—you opened up your heart to me, too.

          As time went by, I started showing you every side of me—my good sides and my flaws—and you were there for me, always.

        <div class="event-title">Miles Apart, But Close <span>October 2024</span></div>
        <div class="event-desc">
          When September ended and October came, I went back to Saudi. At one point, I was just a few minutes away from you. I finally tried your favorite matcha place, Pick. Then I went back to California, and on October 25th, we had our first one-hour call. We started getting even closer from that moment.

        <div class="event-desc">
          November was the month you forced me to make cupcakes—and honestly, I did it better than you! We were extremely close, calling each other for hours every day.

        <div class="event-title">Winter & Understanding <span>December 2024</span></div>
        <div class="event-desc">
          December felt a little different. We were still close, but because I was back in Saudi, we didn’t call as much. But we understood each other. I even went to an ice cream shop and wrote your quote there:

          January came, and I went to London and then back to California. I got sick, and you were scared for me. It was a rough time, but I’ll always joke about it because it made me happy to see how much you cared. <span class="arabic">خفتي علي وردييييييي</span>

        <div class="event-title">Closeness <span>February 2025</span></div>
        <div class="event-desc">
          February brought us even closer. We called every day, and had so many sleep calls. We slept and woke up to each other’s voices. And that month, you officially became part of the Liverpool fan club—you got your first Liverpool shirt! I love you, 7bebti.<br>
          We used to vlog, call, chat—everything. We were closer than ever.

        <div class="event-title">Proud <span>April 2025</span></div>
        <div class="event-desc">
          April was the month you were nervous about Qudrat, but you got an 85! I was so, so proud of you. And you got to smell me for the first time (Celtics jerseyyyyyyyyyyyyyy) and wear me.

        <div class="event-desc">
          At the end of April and into May, we started Facetiming for the first time. It started by accident when you opened the camera, but it turned into something so beautiful. I saw your eyes for the first time, and you told me "I love you." That was one of the best feelings ever, Wardy.

        <div class="event-title">Growing Stronger <span>June 2025</span></div>
        <div class="event-desc">
          Then June came, and we were more mature than ever. We thought about our relationship, learned from the past, and became stronger than ever. Nothing can break us. My family came, and it was a period filled with updating each other. I missed you so much and wanted you every day.
          This month, we built something for a better future for both of us. I can’t wait to marry you and spend the rest of our lives together—with our kids, and all the matcha and cupcakes you want.
